I have trained a yolo 8 model to detect the players of two teams, referee, and the ball in a video. 

Here the model can detect the players, referee, and ball from Fc Barcelona vs Real Madrid game

We gathered Cropping pictures of the players to train our clustering model

Now the model can separate the players into two teams and the goalkeepers will be assigned to the closer players.
